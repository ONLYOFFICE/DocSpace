    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

Here are three simple questions for you which can help us make your user experience even more comfortable.

* Do you have a big team or lots of customers and partners to collaborate with in your ONLYOFFICE DocSpace? 

* Would you like to create any number of rooms to work with numerous documents? 

* Do you want to use ONLYOFFICE DocSpace under your own brand?

If you have at least one ‘yes’ answer, opt for the BUSINESS tariff plan which allows you to add any desired number of managers to your ONLYOFFICE DocSpace as well as apply branding options.

To do so, please consult the "Payments section":"$PricingPage" of your ONLYOFFICE DocSpace. There, you will find an individual link to the Stripe Customer Portal where you can easily handle all the payment details. 

_Please note: The person who pays the subscription becomes the payer. Only the payer is able to make changes to the subscription (adjust the number of managers). Users don’t have access to the payments details. The owner of the ONLYOFFICE DocSpace account is able to reassign the payer anytime later. _

    <value>Hello, $UserName!

We hope you enjoy using your ONLYOFFICE DocSpace. Here are some tips on how to make work on documents more effective.

*#1. Choose the way you work.* Organize your workflow as you need it by creating collaboration rooms for real-time co-authoring or custom rooms with flexible settings for any purpose.

*#2. Work with any content you have.* Store and work with files of different formats within your rooms: text documents, spreadsheets, presentations, digital forms, PDFs, e-books, multimedia.

*#3. Co-author effectively.* Collaborate on documents with two co-editing modes: real-time or paragraph-locking. Track changes, communicate in real-time using the built-in chat or making audio and video calls.

*#4. Connect 3rd party clouds.* Connect any cloud storage and work without switching between apps.
