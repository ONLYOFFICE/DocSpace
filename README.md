## Simple Building and Running Test Example in Docker

> **Note:** DO NOT USE THIS VERSION IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS.
> The following instructions create a **development/testing environment**
> not suitable for production use. For production deployment, see:
> [Production Version of ONLYOFFICE DocSpace](https://www.onlyoffice.com/download.aspx#docspace-enterprise)

1. Clone the DocSpace repository with submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DocSpace && \
cd "$(basename "$_" .git)" && \
git submodule foreach "git checkout master"
```

2. Run Docker Images:

```bash
# Change the directory to the docker directory
cd ./docker
# Make sure to run the below command from the ./docker/ directory,
# so the .env file is used for configuration.
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

3. Open your web browser (Chrome, Opera, etc.) and run: http://localhost

4. If you need SSL

> **Note:** You must ensure that:
> Each domain/subdomain you use (e.g., portal.domain.example, sub.portal.domain.example) has a valid DNS A record (or AAAA for IPv6)
> The DNS record points to the public IP address of your server
> ❌ If DNS is not set correctly, Let's Encrypt will fail to validate the domain and no certificate will be issued.

```bash
# Make the Script Executable
chmod +x init_ssl.sh
# Run the script with your domain(s) and email: ./init_ssl.sh --domain "${domain(s)}" --email "${email}" 
./init_ssl.sh --domain "portal.domain.example,sub_portal.portal.domain.example" --email "your_email@domain.example"
# --domain: A comma-separated list of domains and subdomains
# --email: Your email address for Let's Encrypt registration and renewal notices
```
Open your web browser (Chrome, Opera, etc.) and run: https://portal.domain.example
